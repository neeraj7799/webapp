            <p>I have done my Masters in Computer Science from Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden. I have been working as a Data Engineer at Hudson Data since July 2018 and am greatly interested in leveraging my strategic and technical background for this position.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have an innate passion for building cost-optimal solutions and would like to walk you through the most recent solution that I have delivered. Implemented a solution based on Dataproc (Spark) for reducing the costs of processing 1PB data instead of using the existing data warehouse solution. This is part of pre-processing done for building a model using the reject inference technique to reduce bias. This instance of my work at Hudson Data is portrayed with an intent to establish my strong expertise within building ETL pipelines and Data Management/Migration in general.</p>
